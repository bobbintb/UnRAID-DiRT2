## Development Setup

Before starting any development task, you **must** set up the Node.js environment.

1.  Navigate to the `nodejs` directory:
    ```bash
    cd nodejs
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

This will install all necessary dependencies, including the Playwright browser binaries required for frontend verification.
